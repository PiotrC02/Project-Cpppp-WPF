# Project-Cpppp-WPF
# Presented here are the projects accomplished throughout the C# programming course.
# The project is currently underway as part of a semester assignment for one of the object-oriented programming courses. The concept revolves around developing an application (.exe) that will display weather information based on user selection - for today, the upcoming week, or the entire month. It will function as a widget, capable of dynamically adjusting its window size according to the selected display mode. The data will be presented in various formats; for instance, temperature will be represented by a thermometer bar (blue for cold, red for warm), wind direction by an arrow, humidity level, perceived temperature, and graphical representations such as a sun icon for sunny weather or a cloud with raindrops for rainy conditions. Users will also have the option to select their preferred city. All this data will be retrieved from a separate API tasked with communicating with an external HTTP server to supply our application with the necessary information. The 'Weather Widget' would then present the data as described earlier.
